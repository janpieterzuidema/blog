<b>Hello world</b> is the title of my first blog post. Thank you for visiting my blog. 
In this blog I will keep track of my journey to build up a passive income stream, so I the future
I have options on what I am going to do with my life. <!--more-->

Hopefully I can become Financial Independent (FI) at the moment I am not sure. But what I do know is that saving and 
investing is important to become FI. Stop spending money on things you don't need and try to keep a nice savings rate. 
The savings rate is the percentage of ones income that can be saved. I have started tracking my savings rate since 2016.
That year my savings rate was 37% and I am pretty happy with that figure. I don't expect to achieve the same figure in 2017
but we will see what happens, at the moment I am on the right track I think.

On this site you'll find my [portfolio](../portfolio) of stocks and my [dividend income](../dividendincome).
My goal is to post articles about investing, dividend income updates and new additions to my portfolio.
