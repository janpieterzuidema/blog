            <h4>About Me.</h4>
            <p>Hi, and welcome to Investing for Freedom.</p>
            <p>I am a 36 year guy living in The Netherlands, i have a wife and no kids. I currently work as a software developer. I love programming, carp-fishing and investing.</p>
            <br/>
            <h4>Why investing in the stock market?<h4>
            <p>The first reason I started investing was back in late 2013, when I noticed that the interest rate of my savings account was near 1%. And that is pretty low. This was the trigger for me to decide to invest in stocks. At that time I didn't knew anything about investing in the stock market. So I started figuring out how to invest. First I opened an account at a broker, I started to buy some EFT's. 
            Right after that value investing came to my attention. I've read The Intelligent Investor for Mr. Graham and other books about value investing. I've started reading lots of articles on the internet. I came to the conclusion that value investing is the way to go. When 2016 was half way I learned about Dividend Growth Investing and I saw a lot of blogs and other information about this subject on the internet. Dividend Growth Investing is sure interesting and in my portfolio there are a few dividend growth stocks. I am not sure what type of strategy is the best value investing or dividend growth investing. Currently I use both I think. But I try to keep learing about those things to ultimatly become a better investor.
            </p>
            <p>The second reason is I got interested in becoming financial independent (FI), there are a lot of blogs and books about this subject, so I learned stuff about this and I am still learning. I don't know if I ever become FI but I am going to try to make a big passive income stream as possible so that later on in my life I have options. Currently I am tracking all my income en expenses in an Excel sheet and I also keep an eye on my savings rate, because that is really important when somebody wants to become FI.</p>

            <br/>
            <h4>Why a blog?<h4>
            <p>I started this blog to share what happens on my journey and to document this interesting journey. I've also created this blog because I never created a blog, I want to learn this. I want to learn to write articles. This way I will also improve my English I hope because English is not my mother language. So I hope to learn a lot of new stuff and improve existing skills. </p>
