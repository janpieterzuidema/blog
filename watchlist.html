            <p>On this page you'll see stocks I consider adding to my portfolio. Many investors do this and I also think it's a good idea because it gives me some some focus. There are many companies and most of them I don't want to invest in. Some companies in this list I already own, so this means I'm thinking of adding more shares of that company to my portfolio.</p>
